# Reflection Questions

1. What experiences have you had with coding and/or programming so far? What other experiences (programming-related or not) have you had that may help you as you progress through this course?

- I've completed the Full Stack Web Development Immersion which covers MERN & MEAN Stack. 
  
- Check out my portfolio at sam-my.com

- I've been in the mortgage/banking industry for 15+ years and am working on a transition to tech.

- I've also had experience in call center tech support and customer service.

- My communication & troubleshooting skills helped me learned how to code methodically and be able to internalize this programming learning experience in a relatable & simple way. 

2.. What do you know about Python already? What do you want to know?

- Not much outside that it is predominatly used in Machine Learning, Data Science & AI. 

3. What challenges do you think may come up while you take this course? What will help you face them? Think of specific spaces, people, and times of day or week that might be favorable to your facing challenges and growing. Plan for how to solve challenges that arise.

- I'm sure I'll get stuck with and troubleshoot just to find out something silly like I forgot to capitalize something or a trailing slash. 

- Knowing that I have a mentor that I can reach out to is comforting
- The internet, AI, checking forums, learning how to use the python version or techniques of console logging and debugging.   

# Exercise 1.1: Getting Started with Python 

1.	In your own words, what is the difference between frontend and backend web development? If you were hired to work on backend programming for a web application, what kinds of operations would you be working on?

- Frontend is what the user sees visually on the web app: for example buttons, images, text, all the pages and forms etc. 

- Backend is when the user enters info or requests/retrieve data like clicking a button or submitting a form. 
   -  a. A process happens that either grabs the info from the server or delivers the info to the server so it can handle it and update/store it in the database as necessary: API. For example, loading a picture of a movie poster when the user clicks on an icon or link. 
  
   - b. This involves a security system that handles the user logging in or registering where the user has to be verified: Authentication. 
  
   - c. Also a system is in place where user priveleges have been defined: Authorization.  

2.	Imagine you’re working as a full-stack developer in the near future. Your team is asking for your advice on whether to use JavaScript or Python for a project, and you think Python would be the better choice. How would you explain the similarities and differences between the two languages to your team? Drawing from what you learned in this Exercise, what reasons would you give to convince your team that Python is the better option? 
(Hint: refer to the Exercise section “The Benefits of Developing with Python”)

- Based on what I've learned in this course so far in exercise 1.1: 
  
- Python may be easier to read due to it's syntax resembling the natural English language which can make it easier to use and learn when having a team of newer developers or a team that wants to incorporate AI or Machine Learning in the project later down the road.  

3.	Now that you’ve had an introduction to Python, write down 3 goals you have for yourself and your learning during this Achievement. You can reflect on the following questions if it helps you. What do you want to learn about Python? What do you want to get out of this Achievement? Where or what do you see yourself working on after you complete this Achievement?

- I want to demonstrate that I'm versatile to be able to learn a new language outside of the MERN & MEAN stack that I already know. 

- I want to put in practice what the programming & troubleshooting techniques I've learned so far to picking up Python. 

- I want to position myself and use this as a stepping stone to better learn about AI and Machine Learning in the future.
